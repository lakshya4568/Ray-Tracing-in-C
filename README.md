# Ray Tracing in C

In 3D computer graphics, ray tracing is a technique for modeling light transport for use in a wide variety of rendering algorithms for generating digital images.

It's a computer graphics technique that mimics how light works in real life. It traces the path of rays of light as they travel, bounce, reflect, or pass through objects, capturing details like shadows, reflections, and refractions. Imagine shiny floors, crystal-clear glass, or water ripplesâ€”ray tracing makes them all look jaw-droppingly realistic.





## Documentation

I will be using the SDL2 Libary for graphic render and all the details will be added here.
