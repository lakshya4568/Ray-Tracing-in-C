# Ray Tracing in C

In 3D computer graphics, ray tracing is a technique for modeling light transport for use in a wide variety of rendering algorithms for generating digital images.

It's a computer graphics technique that mimics how light works in real life. It traces the path of rays of light as they travel, bounce, reflect, or pass through objects, capturing details like shadows, reflections, and refractions. Imagine shiny floors, crystal-clear glass, or water ripplesâ€”ray tracing makes them all look jaw-droppingly realistic.

## Documentation

This project uses the SDL2 library for graphic rendering. Below is a brief explanation of the key components of the code in

### Key Components

1. **Initialization**
    - The SDL2 video subsystem is initialized. If initialization fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.

2. **Window Creation**
    - An SDL window is created with the title "Ray Tracing", centered on the screen with a width of 800 pixels and a height of 600 pixels. If window creation fails, an error message is printed, SDL subsystems are cleaned up, and the program exits.

3. **Event Handling**
    - An SDL event variable is declared to handle events. A flag (`running`) is used to control the main loop. The main event loop processes events in the queue and checks if the event is a quit event (e.g., window close). If a quit event is detected, the `running` flag is set to 0 to exit the loop.

4. **Frame Rate Control**
    - A delay is introduced to control the frame rate, approximately 16ms for ~60 FPS.

5. **Cleanup**
    - The created window is destroyed to free resources, and all initialized SDL subsystems are cleaned up before the program exits.

### How to Compile and Run

1. **Install SDL2 Library**
    - On macOS, you can install SDL2 using Homebrew:

      ```sh
      brew install sdl2
      ```

2. **Compile the Code**

    ```sh
    gcc -o raytracing raytracing.c -I/opt/homebrew/include/SDL2 -D_THREAD_SAFE -L/opt/homebrew/lib -lSDL2
    ```

3. **Run the Executable**

    ```sh
    ./raytracing
    ```

This README provides an overview of the raytracing.c file, explaining the key components of the code and how to compile and run the program.

### Creation of a cirlce In SDL 2
>
> **NOTE**: SDL 2 does not have a built-in function to draw a circle. However, you can create a circle by drawing multiple points along the circumference of the circle.

```c
void FillCircle(SDL_Surface *s, Circle circle, Uint32 color) {};
```

- We can create a circle by treating each rectangle as a pixel, here we can use the equation of a circle to draw the circle.

- By calculating, distance of radius, x and y corrdinate of the circle, and loop over it can give us the circle.

- x-radius, x+radius, y-radius, y+radius are the boundries of the circle and looping over it can give us the circle.

- we will take the distance square, and radius square and check if the distance square is less than the radius square, then circle will be drawn.

### Movement of the Circle

We can move the circle by changing the x and y coordinate of the circle.

#### Updating Circle Movements with SDL Events

To update the circle movements, we handle SDL events in the main event loop. Specifically, we handle SDL_MOUSEMOTION events to update the circle's position based on the mouse's coordinates.

1. **Event Handling for Circle Movement**

- In the main event loop, we check for `SDL_MOUSEMOTION` events.
- If a `SDL_MOUSEMOTION` event is detected and the mouse button is pressed, we update the circle's x and y coordinates to the mouse's current position.

### `BasicAntialiasing(SDL_Surface *surface)`

Applies a basic box blur effect to smooth edges in the rendered image.

- **Parameters:**
  - `surface`: SDL surface to apply anti-aliasing to

  - Uses a 3x3 kernel to average neighboring pixels

  - Applies averaging calculation for each pixel

- **Parameters:**
  - `circle`: Source circle from which rays originate
  - `rays`: Array to store generated rays
- **Process:**
  - Distributes rays evenly in 360 degrees
  - Each ray stores starting position and angle

### `FillRays(SDL_Surface *surface, Ray rays[RAYS_NUMBER], Uint32 color, Circle Object)`

Renders rays and handles ray-circle intersection calculations.

- **Parameters:**
  - `surface`: SDL surface to draw on
  - `rays`: Array of rays to render
  - `color`: Color of the rays
  - `Object`: Circle to check for intersections
- **Process:**
  - Iterates through each ray
  - Incrementally draws ray paths
  - Checks for collisions with object
  - Stops ray rendering at screen boundaries or object intersections
  - Uses distance formula for collision detection

### `FillCircle(SDL_Surface *s, Circle circle, Uint32 color)`

Draws a filled circle on the SDL surface.

- **Parameters:**
  - `s`: SDL surface to draw on
  - `circle`: Circle structure containing position and radius
  - `color`: Color to fill the circle with
- **Process:**
  - Uses distance formula to determine which pixels fall within circle
  - Iterates through rectangular boundary of circle
  - Fills pixels that fall within radius
  - Creates solid circle appearance

### `main()`

Main program loop and initialization.

- **Process:**
  - Initializes SDL video subsystem
  - Creates window and gets surface
  - Sets up initial circle and shadow circle objects
  - Handles event loop for:
    - Window closing
    - Mouse movement
    - Circle updates
  - Manages animation timing

  - Cleans up resources on exit
